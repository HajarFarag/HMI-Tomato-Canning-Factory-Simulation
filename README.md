## Overview
This project involves the use of a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and Human-Machine Interface (HMI) to automate the production of canned tomatoes. The process includes rinsing and chopping tomatoes, filling cans with tomatoes and preserving liquids, labelling the cans, and preparing them for shipment. This system aims to streamline the manufacturing process, enhancing efficiency and productivity.
